## ‚úÖ **Tasks Completed**  

### Task 1: Loan Approval Prediction  
- Built a machine learning model to predict **loan approval status** using applicant details (income, credit history, loan amount, etc.).  
- Performed **data preprocessing** including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  
- Implemented classification models such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**.  
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.  

### Task 2: Forest Cover Type Classification  
- Implemented a **multi-class classification model** using the Forest Cover Type dataset from Kaggle.  
- Preprocessed numerical and categorical features, applied **feature scaling** and **encoding**.  
- Trained models like **Random Forest and XGBoost**, and compared their performance.  
- Visualized **confusion matrices and feature importance** for deeper insights.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation  
- Performed **unsupervised learning** to segment customers into meaningful groups based on purchasing behavior.  
- Applied clustering techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN.  
- Extracted insights to help businesses target customers with personalized strategies.

### Task 4: Movie Recommendation System  
- Developed a **content-based movie recommender system** using the TMDB 5000 dataset.  
- Engineered features from **overview, genres, keywords, cast, and director**.  
- Applied **CountVectorizer** and computed **cosine similarity** to recommend movies.  
- Implemented a reusable `recommend(title, n)` function.  
- Added **visualizations** for top genres, popularity distribution, and similarity spread.
