# Elevvo Pathways – Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to the official repository of my **Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**. This repository showcases all the tasks I completed as part of the internship program, each designed to apply and strengthen core machine learning concepts through real-world datasets and challenges.

Each task is organized in a dedicated folder with well-documented code, analysis, and results. The projects involve data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization—using popular tools and libraries in Python.
